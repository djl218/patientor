# Patientor

This is the frontend code for the Patientor app.  An app that uses TypeScript to manage patient data.

The state management is built using React Hooks `useContext` and `useReducer`.  The styling is done with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for navigation.  Also [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) is used for form handling.
